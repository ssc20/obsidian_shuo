Advice
- try out any of David's programs from class via Week 2's examples
- To see the manual pages for C functions, visit manual.cs50.io
- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make` , focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. 
- If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. 
- For instance, if trying to compile `readability` and `make readability` is yielding errors, try running `help50 make readability` instead!

## Scrabble
#pset/2
### Problem to solve
In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.

For example, if we wanted to score the word "CODE", we would note that the 'C' is worth 3 points, the 'O' is worth 1 point, the 'D' is worth 2 points, and the 'E' is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that "CODE" is worth 7 points.

In a file called `scrabble.c` in a folder called `scrabble`, implement a program in C that determines the winner of a short Scrabble-like game. Your program should prompt for input twice: once for "Player 1" to input their word and once for "Player 2" to input their word. Then, depending on which player scores the most points your program should either print "Player 1 wins!", "Player 2 wins!", or "Tie!" (in the event that two players score equal points).

### Advice and Hints
- write some code that you know will compile
- Write some pseudocode before writing more code
- Convert the pseudocode to code

### Correctness
- in terminal run
	- `check50 cs50/problems/2024/x/scrabble`
- submit:

# Compiling
#compiling
- compilers have acted as an abstraction

source code > compiler > machine code

- bottom-up understanding of what it could be
- hello world:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void
		{
			printf("Hello world\n".)
		})
```
- make itself is not a compiler, but a program that runs the compler for you
- runs a program called `clang`
- if i just run clang hello.c
	- `bash: there is no such file or directory`
	- running ./a.out actually works
- we can configure clang with command line arguments that somehow modify the behaviour of a program
	- create a program called hello...
	- `clang -o hello hello.c`
	- second version with the
```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	string name = get_string("What's your name? ");
	printf("hello, %s\n", name);
}
```

- error once running `clang -o hello hello.c`
	- linker command failed...
- when using a 3rd party library, you must use an additional command line argument
- `clang - o hello hello.c -lcs50`
- make has been inputting these command line arguments for you
- compiling is 1 of 4 steps that get involved in turning binary into outputs

- Preprocessing
	```c
	#include <cs50.h>
	int main(void)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i ++)
		{
			meow();
		}
	}
void meow(void)
{
	printf("meow\n");
}
	```
- The hashcodes for the library inclusions can be thought of as `pre-processing directives`
- The code gets compiled into something called assembly language
	- people wrote in assembly used this!
		- people before that used machine code, be it in code or punch cards
	- compiler > assembly language
		- printf, get_string are referenced in the assembly code
		- ![[Pasted image 20240113204606.png]]
- clang names the output file `a` because "assembly"
- compiling
	- clang, assembly code
- assembling
	- assembly code into 1's and 0's
- linking
	- takes all of the 0s and 1s of the 3 files intelligently into one single file
	- - there are 3 different files:
	- `cs50.h`
	- `stdio.h`
	- `.c`
	- so:
		- hello.c 
		- cs50.c
		- stdio.c
	- Clang must compile all of these into the corresponding 0s and 1s
		- the 0s and 1s must be linked together.
	- i guess taking source code and libraries?

- Compiling: process of taking our source code which takes your source code into assembly code
	- other compoiles?
		- Gcc: GNU COMPILER COLLECTION
		- clang is somewhat more recent
			- the error messages are more user-friendly
		- alternatives to compiling exist
- implications of source code into machine code?
	- maybe you can decompile it?
	- go from 0s and 1s into source code?
		- change something in another person's code
		- then people with MacS and PCs can take all of that and reverse engineer it
- Reverse engineering
	- easier said then done
	- Loops alone
		- for
		- while
		- do-while
	- typically lose the variable and function names typically
	- generally the midnset is if you're good to decomplile it, 
		- could implement?
	- having techniques 
# Debugging
#debugging
- going through Mario program
	- ![[CleanShot 2024-01-13 at 21.03.07.png]]
		- seeing 4 hashes in a line, I'm looking for only 3
		- `printf` technique
			- `printf("i is %i\n", i)`
			- ![[CleanShot 2024-01-13 at 21.05.39.png]]
			- ![[CleanShot 2024-01-13 at 21.05.56.png]]
	- The canonical solution here would be to change the `<=` to `<`
		- now the code matches expectations
		- remember to remove the debugging lines of code
		- this can devolve into trial and error
	- if you ever find yourself slipping down the hill, better to use something other than `printf`
- next example:
	- ![[CleanShot 2024-01-13 at 21.11.37.png]]
	- ![[CleanShot 2024-01-13 at 21.11.46.png]]
	- the initial issue is that the prototype is missing
	- let's look at a debugger
		- `debug50`
		- the debugger needs your code to already be compiled
		- `debug 50 ./buggy`
	- What you need to run debugger
		- breakpoints
			- where do you want to pause?
			- might have accidentally this
			- the red dot in the gutter of VS Code
				- "gutter" is the space behind the line numbers
			- setting break point = red dot
			- set the breakpoint on the first line of executable code
				- highlighted in yellowish code
			- showcases variables
				- locals
					- `h` in this example, shows a "garbage value"
						- h: 21912
					- call stack feature
			- below, there is a `WATCH` section
				- `call stack`
				- `main()`
				- hitting the play button will run from start to end
			- Step into, poke around the contents of `get_int`
			- these buttons are going to be our friends
			- "Step over"
				- doesn't mean skip
				- means execute, but don't bother me by going into the weeds
				- ![[CleanShot 2024-01-13 at 21.54.50.png]]
			- typing in "3"
				- the variable `h` should take on the value of 3
				- we will see the "locals h" update to 3
				- Output would have outputted 4 hashes
			- I want to see what happens in `print_column(h)`
			- yellow highlight now jumps into the function
			- comparing i against height, you should be able to see this
			- height is still 3, but i keeps incrementing
		- clicking "Step Over"
			- notice that 3 is less than or equal to height, and that means the hash is still printing
		- can fix code and now it should work!


```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include<stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
	string name = get_string("Name: ");
	int length = strlen(name);
	printf("%i\n", length);
}
```
- within cs50.h one line of code thta defines return value, the function name and the arguments for get_string
#libraries
#c 

```c
int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
	...
}
```
- the above code is an example of an alternative to `int main(void)`
#argc #argv 

Exit status
#exitstatus
- one other thing about the code we've been writing
- all programs eventually exit because we see that they exit
- every program has an "exit status"
	- by default, it will always be 0
- every other number in the world, than 0, it's bad
- "An unknown error occurred"
	- Error code: 1132
		- zoom, somehow had an error, and returned "1132"
		- some programmer at Zoom might have understanding of what is happening here
	- error code: 404
		- means file not found, webpage not found
		- numbers that represent errors
		- not necessarily an exist status
- this means that the `int main(int argc, string argv[])` lines will always return some kind of `int`
	- our programs can return values
- every program exited with `0` as the exit status/return value by default
- this is useful inherently to troubleshooting/class QA
- can use `echo $?` to see the return value of the last program ran
- get in the habit of automatically testing your code
	- these test can detect the status codes, knowing that your code succeeds or fails
- goal of this week: is to solve problems

#cryptography
- cryptography is the art of the science of encrypting
	- encrypting: scrambling information
	- ability to send info securely
	- whether it is in file-format or wirelessly
- if i look at this message and encrypted, no one can see but me and the recipient
- plain text > ? > ciphertext --> plaintext > cipher > ciphertext
- ciphertext is what you want to convert into..
- cipher: algorithm for encrypting or scrambling information in a reversible way
- ciphers take as input not only the plaintext message in English, but also a key
- metaphorically, keys open locks
	- but its generally a big number
		- 32 bit, 64 bit, 1024 bits
	- for all intents and purposes you are secure
- Let's say for `HI!`
	- our secret is going to be `1`
		- `1` is my key, in this example
		- `HI!` > `IJ`
			- effectively incr. alphabet +1 char
			- get to Z, wrap back to A
				- shift the alphabet by +1 place
			- you look at this, then the `!` leaks
			- won't know the message unless decrypted
		- this message is not that secure
		- you could "brute-force" the solution
			- eventually it's going to pop-out
		- this is called the "Caesar" cipher
		- key of 3
			- first person by lore to have thought of this idea!
		- key of 13
			- "ROT 13"
				- HI! > UV!
				- I LOVE YOU > V YBIR LBH
		- key of 26
			- "ROT 26"
			- doesn't always help you...
			- I LOVE YOU > I LOVE YOU
	- Decryption
		- using a key of 1
			- just minus 1!
			- key of 13?
				- subtract 13
	- `UIJT XBT DT50`
		- let's decrypt using `-1`
		- this is what the lightbulbs in the video were spelling out
		- `THIS WAS CS50`
			- grab your own rubber duck lmao.

Mikayla and I have been in a committed relationship for the past few years. To my memory, we began dating around 2020, just before the pandemic, while I was still working at Cineplex. We met off of Bumble, a dating app, while she lived in Orillia, a small town far from Toronto. We got along well and we decided to enter a relationship shortly after our first few dates; it was around this time that we made arrangements for her to stay with me at my parents, at Yonge/Finch in Toronto, in a condo. During this time, I was, alongside Mikayla, working at a Community Service firm facilitated by Youth Employment Services while undergoing the process to receive my ADHD diagnosis and for the medication upon diagnosis. It was additionally, while we were living at my parents, that we experienced a severe amount of turbulence revolving around our futures, how long we wanted to stay at my parents, and if the emotional stressors of living with my mother was enough for her to leave. These feelings of uncertainty contributed to a strained period of time in our relationship that lasted for several months without any clear end or certainty that we could observe.

In conjunction, another key point was her turbulent relationship with her father, whom she had elected to live with in Toronto. On the condition that she study UI/UX Design Online at a program that her father had chosen and monthly (relatively reduced) rent payments, her father had offered her his basement apartment for her to live in indefinitely. This created several points of conflict as we would override his over-exerted authority on who she was allowed to bring into the apartment, his infrequent audits of the amount and frequency of work she was doing within her UI/UX program, and the overall disparate condition of the upstairs areas where her dad lived. She noted several times that he had struggled with hoarding, his relationships with women, and his controlling behaviours. These issues ultimately culminated in an incident with her father after about half a year of living in his basement apartment. She had stayed with me late one night after informing her father that she would be home at a certain point

It was during this time that it become apparent to me that Mikayla shared many commonalities in terms of behaviour that I associated personally with ADHD/Autism. This included emotional disregulation, inhibited executive dysfunction, and an tendency to hyper-focus on extremely specific activities. Often, I would feel unusually tired, and this would result in what seemed to me, a build-up of resentment within Mikayla. This caused issues due to my disengagement with sex, recreational time with her, and a disinterest in socializing with friends in person. This would be in spite of me taking my prescribed stimulants, keeping my diet in check, and exercising regularly. She would sometimes lash out at me verbally, refuse to participate in social activities like gaming with my friends, and refuse to leave the bedroom we shared. I noted this down, and brought up to her the possibility of her having symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression, to which she agreed fairly positively. I also noted that she had issues with the co-ordinator of FIT, the community services firm we were working at.

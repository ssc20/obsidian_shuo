**Objectivism**
			- (developed by Ayn Rand, the #1 retard:
			- *"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute"*
				- reality exists independently of consciousness
				- human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception (direct & indirect realism)
				- one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation & inductive logic
				- the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational egoism)
				- the only social system consistent with this morality os one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in *laissez-faire* capitalism (no economic interventionism)
				- the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form (a work of art) that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally
			- the *is-ought* problem
				- David Hume (Scottish Philosopher, historian): when one makes claims about what *ought* to be that are based solely on statements about what *is*
				- significant difference between positive (or descriptive) statements (about what is) and prescriptive/normative statements (about what ought to be)
					- and that it is not obvious how one can coherently transition from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones
				- Hume's law is the thesis that an ethical or judgemental conclusion cannot be inferred from purely descriptive factual statements
			- closely related to the *fact-value* distinction in epistemology

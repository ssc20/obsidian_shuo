Welcome to Dr. K's Guide for Mental Health!

The guide is designed to be a "choose your own adventure" non-linear experience.

Use the "Video Titles" guide map to see the general outline of the guide. Start your adventure at the center of the map by watching the introduction videos and make your way outward, following the colored lines.

Use the "File Names" guide map to find the files that correspond to the video that you are interested in watching. All of the videos are separated into different folders, corresponding to the modules where you can find said videos (the folder with Common Videos is for videos that are from more than 1 module).

There are several files for each video: the video itself, video description and sometimes a worksheet and\or notes. Read the description file to see what meditations are attached to the video you are watching. Not all of the videos have meditations attached to them - look for the meditation icon near the video name in the "Video Titles" guide map.
All of the videos have english subtitles included.

Consult the "Meditation Index" to see a list of available meditations together with tags for each meditation to help you choose the right one for you.

Use the "Glossary" to learn or remind yourself the meaning of the various scientific, psychological or eastern terms discussed in the guide.

Good luck!

Sincerely,
A somewhat healthy gamer

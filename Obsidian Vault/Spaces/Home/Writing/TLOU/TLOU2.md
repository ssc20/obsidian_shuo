# TLOU2 Essay

Ideas

Pewdiepie played this game

TLOU probably has the most proportion of playthrough-only’s

Ellie only has a bastardized image of Joel

In defense of zjoel

## Themes
### Grief
### Metamorphosis
### Fatalism & Determinism
### The Prism (Prison?) of Perception
Joel never desires revenge throughout TLOU; even with Sarah. Even when Ellie is kidnapped, it can be argued that he pursues Ellie out of pragmatism or devotion to their bond.

### Abby Sex Scene Meme

### Pewdiepie's/Creator's influence on the reception of the game
- Leafy 
- Pewdiepie 
- Someordinarygamers 
- Angryjoe

## Dialogue
Tommy: “what a joke”

ellie sacrifices so much, just like TLOU

Dunkey felt robbed, didn’t want ot kill Abby, but logical conclusion

## Dunkey
felt robbed, didn’t want to kill Abby, but its seemingly the only *"logical conclusion"*

Lev saves ellie

Ellie spares Abby

ambiguous

Ellie drifts, becomes unrecognizable, lost her own identity, killing abby no longer means anything

Ellie drifts, becomes unrecognizable, lost her own identity, 
- willing to accept emotionally that killing abby no longer means anything
- where it matters most, the potential death that either leads to self-actualization, or completely ruins any potential: 
	- cognitive understanding that murder as an emotional outlet, irredeemable
	- ellie is forced to consider if it's all been worth it, the last 1% of her mission; does she kill Lev when Ellie understands exactly how Lev would feel?

## Thoughts

Dunkey is a goat.

Joel NEVER killed for revenge
- people will sometimes parallel TLOU1's endings, as well as the Winter arc, with TLOU2, in order to argue that Ellie **would** kill Abby in the same set of circumstances (*do people actually believe this? where the fuck did i get this from?*)
	- as in, like how Joel would not show mercy and seemingly would pursue his revenge, Ellie would/should too
	- this ignores that Joel's decision to save Ellie rests on the laurels of pragmatism, a developed bond with Ellie, and a change in his fundamental personality, all of which are factors into his decision
		- ! DRILL THE POINT IN THAT JOEL WAS A COLD ASSHOLE AT THE START
- these circumstances are completely different and beget completely different conclusions

ELLIE DID NOT MAKE THE DECISION TO SPARE ABBY PURELY BECAUSE OF JOEL
ELLIE MADE THE DECISION TO SAVE HER BECAUSE SHE **CHANGED**

JOEL DID NOT MAKE THE DECISION TO SAVE ELLIE PURELY BECAUSE OF ELLIE
JOEL MADE THE DECISION TO SAVE ELLIE BECAUSE HE **CHANGED**


- Joel spent his entire arc developing himself, his relationship with Ellie, and his relationship with himself, in order to move past the trauma of living in post-apoc America and losing Sarah
- 

- maybe the theme is of regret

    - Regret that you paid for this fucking boring ass game
    - Regret that you gameshared
    - Regret that you watched Pewdiepie play it
    - Regret that the game leaked

“Hateful acts begets another, selfless acts are equally contagious”


Ellie continuously endangers her friends out of her selfish and suicidal inability to let go

- at every avenue where she could stop, she refuses to

## Ludonarrative Criticisms
- ellie has changed and she doesn't kill abby because 'this isn't her'

- it's not what she wants
	- lets abby & lav go end cycle of violence
- main draw of violence is red paste
	- that game and gore is amazing
	- shotguns and mines
- this person... random npcs

## Arguments
### Ludonarrative criticism, or ludonarrative harmony?

## Article Notes
[How many do you have to kill in TLOU2 (Medium Article)](#^6d7909)
- author wrote what was a documented pacifist run for TLOU2
- motivation of the article had to do with argument of 2 parts:
	- @ $ argument: 
	- ! the game *forced* you to kill hundreds of enemies
	- ! the game tried to make you *feel bad* about these killings by having you play as a character affiliated with the same faction as a lot of these enemies
- 2 days ago (at the time of the article) while browsing /r/thelastofus, he saw the following Reddit post

[Ludonarrative dissonance is not a valid critique against TLOU2](#^838b59)
- many bring up ludonarrative dissonance as an argument against Ellie sparing Abby
- ? Ludonarrative Dissonance: the conflict between a video game's narrative told through the non-interactive elements and the narrative told through the gameplay
	- (ludonarrative is a compound portmanteau of ludology & narrative)
		- ludology is the study of games/game theory
		- ludic elements: (gameplay)
		- narrative elements
	- Clint Hocking coined the term on his blog, in what is being referenced is 2007s *Bioshock*
		- Hocking says *Bioshock* is written around principles of [[Objectivism]]



# To sort out later
## Playthrough-only

## /r/tlou2 "sources of diverse criticism"
- [Reddit - Dive into anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastOfUs2/wiki/sourcesofdiversecriticism/)
	- [How They Ruined Ellie: An Essay : r/TheLastOfUs2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastOfUs2/comments/jpxgr0/how_they_ruined_ellie_an_essay/)
		- this essay is horribly written and does nothing to substantiates any of its arguments for why they think Ellie is acting differently
	- [anything & everything on Tumblr: Joel did not doom humanity (no matter how much the second game wants you to believe that)](https://www.tumblr.com/yeeyee-alumni/652500070792642561/joel-did-not-doom-humanity-no-matter-how-much-the)
	- the premise of this assumes that TLOU2 is presenting the view that the socio-philosophical implications of Joel's choice at the end of TLOU1 have any actual bearing on TLOU2's plot
		- it also assumes that various characters are to be portrayed as "evil"
			- counter, albeit somewhat dependent on your interpretation of TLOU1: there is no evidence that specific characters are supposed to be portrayed as "evil"
				- anecdote with Mikayla, she didn't think Abby was evil
	- [anything & everything on Tumblr: Ellie’s (lack of a) character arc & why the result is an unsatisfying story](https://www.tumblr.com/yeeyee-alumni/652369946577420288/ellies-lack-of-a-character-arc-why-the-result)
		- [[Ellie's (lack of a) character arc & why the result is an unsatisfying story]]		
		- ***Summary per ChatGPT4 (because holy fuck shit's ugly as all hell to read)***
		- The text critiques Ellie's character arc in TLOU2, arguing that **it lacks a genuine transformation** due to several reasons:
			- the change in Ellie is abrupt rather than gradual
			- it appears unprovoked
			- is not informed by the narrative or character development
		- the writer contents that Ellie's shift from seeking revenge to suddenly deciding to forgive Abby, her antagonist, is unconvincing and poorly executed
			- the sudden change is criticized as being prompted by a conveniently timed flashback rather than a meaningful, reflective process
		- the text disputes the plausibility and depth of Ellie's forgiveness, highlighting inconsistencies in her behaviour and the narrative's failure to convincingly portray her internal conflict or growth
		- it also criticizes the game for making characters act out of character or without sufficient motivation
			- especially in the climax where Ellie's actions seem contradictory and forced
		- the writer suggests an alternative ending that would align more consistently with Ellie's established traits and the game's thematic elements
			- (more thoughtful approach to character development and resolution)
		- they conclude by addressing criticisms of the game's ending, defending the validity of diverse player reactions and emphasizing the importance of coherent storytelling over contrived narrative twists.

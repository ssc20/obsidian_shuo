[anything & everything on Tumblr: Ellieâ€™s (lack of a) character arc & why the result is an unsatisfying story](https://www.tumblr.com/yeeyee-alumni/652369946577420288/ellies-lack-of-a-character-arc-why-the-result)

To offer rebuttals to the premise that all characters in "The Last of Us Part 2" (TLOU2) experience development, we can examine the structure of character development, the narrative choices made in the game, and how these choices affect our perception of character growth. The argument against the premise might focus on the following points:

1. **Character Development vs. Character Change:** Character development implies a depth of transformation, involving nuanced shifts in beliefs, values, or behavior due to experiences and challenges faced within the narrative. If characters in TLOU2 exhibit changes that are sudden, lack sufficient narrative support, or are inconsistent with their established traits, this could be seen as change without development. For example, if a character's transformation occurs primarily through abrupt plot devices rather than through a natural progression of their experiences and internal reflections, it might not constitute true development.
    
2. **Narrative Integration:** Effective character development is seamlessly integrated into the narrative, allowing characters to evolve in ways that are informed by their interactions, conflicts, and resolutions within the story. If TLOU2's characters experience shifts that feel disjointed from the narrative or are based on contrived circumstances, it could be argued that these moments reflect poor narrative integration, undermining the authenticity of their development.
    
3. **Depth and Complexity of Change:** True character development involves exploring the complexities of a character's psyche, including their motivations, fears, and desires. If the game presents characters' transformations in a superficial manner, without delving into the psychological and emotional underpinnings of their actions, it could be critiqued for offering a simplistic view of development. For instance, if a character's decision to forgive or seek revenge appears unmoored from a deep, introspective journey, it may not resonate as genuine development.
    
4. **Consistency with Character Arcs:** Characters may be introduced with certain arcs intended to guide their development. If the execution of these arcs in TLOU2 is inconsistent, with characters acting against their established motivations or without clear reasons for their shifts in perspective, this could be seen as a flaw in character development. True development should align with the arc's direction, even if the outcomes are unexpected, ensuring that changes are believable and rooted in the character's journey.
    
5. **Relatability and Believability:** For character development to be effective, it must resonate with the audience on a relatable and believable level. If the transformations of characters in TLOU2 are perceived as forced, unnatural, or serving the plot rather than stemming from genuine growth, this might suggest that the development is not convincingly portrayed. Characters' decisions and evolutions should feel like the result of their experiences and the world they inhabit, allowing players to empathize with and understand their journeys.
    
6. **Impact of Development on the Story:** Finally, the ultimate test of character development is its impact on the narrative and the audience's engagement. If the purported development of characters in TLOU2 does not significantly affect the story's outcome or the themes explored, or if it leaves players feeling unsatisfied or disconnected from the characters, it could be argued that the development was ineffective or superficial.
    

These points provide a framework for critiquing the premise that all characters in TLOU2 experience development, focusing on the depth, authenticity, and integration of their transformations within the narrative.

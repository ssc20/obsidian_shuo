Haliah interlude 

The sun that’s on your skin, 
cuz your aura glistening,
from the light that shines within 
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my, Oh my, 

From the way that you pop your smile, 
makes me wanna stay a while, 
cuz your swags a different style 

Oh my, Oh my, Oh my, Oh my, 
I just thought that I’d let you know, 
that you got a special glow, 
and I think the world should know,


For life, For life, For life, For life,

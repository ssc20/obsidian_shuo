# TLOU2 Essay




## Themes
### Grief
### Metamorphosis
### Fatalism & Determinism
### The Prism (Prison?) of Perception
Joel never desires revenge throughout TLOU; even with Sarah. Even when Ellie is kidnapped, it can be argued that he pursues Ellie out of pragmatism or devotion to their bond.

### Abby Sex Scene Meme

- Angryjoe

## Dialogue
Tommy: “what a joke”

ellie sacrifices so much, just like TLOU

## Dunkey
felt robbed, didn’t want to kill Abby, but its seemingly the only *"logical conclusion"*

Lev saves ellie

Ellie spares Abby

ambiguous

Ellie drifts, becomes unrecognizable, lost her own identity, 
- willing to accept emotionally that killing abby no longer means anything
- where it matters most, the potential death that either leads to self-actualization, or completely ruins any potential: 
	- cognitive understanding that murder as an emotional outlet, irredeemable
	- ellie is forced to consider if it's all been worth it, the last 1% of her mission; does she kill Lev when Ellie understands exactly how Lev would feel?

## Thoughts

Dunkey is a goat.


Joel NEVER killed for revenge
- people will sometimes parallel TLOU1's endings, as well as the Winter arc, with TLOU2, in order to argue that Ellie **would** kill Abby in the same set of circumstances (*do people actually believe this? where the fuck did i get this from?*)
	- as in, like how Joel would not show mercy and seemingly would pursue his revenge, Ellie would/should too
	- this ignores that Joel's decision to save Ellie rests on the laurels of pragmatism, a developed bond with Ellie, and a change in his fundamental personality, all of which are factors into his decision
		- ! DRILL THE POINT IN THAT JOEL WAS A COLD ASSHOLE AT THE START
- these circumstances are completely different and beget completely different conclusions

ELLIE DID NOT MAKE THE DECISION TO SPARE ABBY PURELY BECAUSE OF JOEL
ELLIE MADE THE DECISION TO SAVE HER BECAUSE SHE **CHANGED**

JOEL DID NOT MAKE THE DECISION TO SAVE ELLIE PURELY BECAUSE OF ELLIE
JOEL MADE THE DECISION TO SAVE ELLIE BECAUSE HE **CHANGED**
- Joel spent his entire arc developing himself, his relationship with Ellie, and his relationship with himself, in order to move past the trauma of living in post-apoc America and losing Sarah
- 

- maybe the theme is of regret
    - Regret that you paid for this fucking boring ass game
    - Regret that you gameshared
    - Regret that you watched Pewdiepie play it
    - Regret that the game leaked

“Hateful acts begets another, selfless acts are equally contagious”


Ellie continuously endangers her friends out of her selfish and suicidal inability to let go

- at every avenue where she could stop, she refuses to

## Ludonarrative Criticisms
- ellie has changed and she doesn't kill abby because 'this isn't her'
- it's not what she wants
	- lets abby & lav go end cycle of violence
- main draw of violence is red paste
	- that game and gore is amazing
	- shotguns and mines
- this person... random npcs

## Article Notes
[How many do you have to kill in TLOU2 (Medium Article)](#^6d7909)
- author wrote what was a documented pacifist run for TLOU2
- motivation of the article had to do with argument of 2 parts:
	- @ $ argument: 
	- ! the game *forced* you to kill hundreds of enemies
	- ! the game tried to make you *feel bad* about these killings by having you play as a character affiliated with the same faction as a lot of these enemies
- 2 days ago (at the time of the article) while browsing /r/thelastofus, he saw the following Reddit post

[Ludonarrative dissonance is not a valid critique against TLOU2](#^838b59)
- many bring up ludonarrative dissonance as an argument against Ellie sparing Abby
- ? Ludonarrative Dissonance: the conflict between a video game's narrative told through the non-interactive elements and the narrative told through the gameplay
	- (ludonarrative is a compound portmanteau of ludology & narrative)
		- ludology is the study of games/game theory
		- ludic elements: (gameplay)
		- narrative elements
	- Clint Hocking coined the term on his blog, in what is being referenced is 2007s *Bioshock*
		- Hocking says *Bioshock* is written around principles of [[Objectivism]]

# To sort out later
## Playthrough-only
TLOU probably has the most proportion of playthrough-only's
## In defence of Joel
Ellie only has a bastardized image of Joel

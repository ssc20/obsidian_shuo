Ideas

Pewdiepie played this game

TLOU probably has the most proportion of playthrough-only’s

Ellie only has a bastardized image of Joel

## Themes
### Grief
### Metamorphosis
### Fatalism & Determinism
### The Prism (Prison?) of Perception

Ellie spares Abby

    - Regret that you paid for this fucking boring ass game
    - Regret that you gameshared
    - Regret that you watched Pewdiepie play it
    - Regret that the game leaked

# TLOU2 Essay




## Themes
### Grief
### Metamorphosis
### Fatalism & Determinism
### The Prism (Prison?) of Perception
Joel never desires revenge throughout TLOU; even with Sarah. Even when Ellie is kidnapped, it can be argued that he pursues Ellie out of pragmatism or devotion to their bond.

### Abby Sex Scene Meme

## Dialogue
Tommy: “what a joke”

ellie sacrifices so much, just like TLOU

Dunkey felt robbed, didn’t want to kill Abby, but its seemingly the only *"logical conclusion"*

Lev saves ellie

Ellie spares Abby

ambiguous

Ellie drifts, becomes unrecognizable, lost her own identty, killing abby no longer means anything

- “maybe the theme is of regret
    - Regret that you paid for this fucking boring ass game
    - Regret that you gameshared
    - Regret that you watched Pewdiepie play it
    - Regret that the game leaked

“Hateful acts begets another, selfless acts are equally contagious”


Ellie continuously endangers her friends out of her selfish and suicidal inability to let go

- at every avenue where she could stop, she refuses to

## Ludonarrative
- ellie has changed doesn't killa by because this isn't her
- it's not what she wants
	- lets abby & lav go end cycle of violence
- main draw of violence is red paste
	- that game and gore is amazing
	- shotguns and mines
- this person... random npcs


# To sort out later
## Playthrough-only
TLOU probably has the most proportion of playthrough-only's
## In defence of Joel
Ellie only has a bastardized image of Joel

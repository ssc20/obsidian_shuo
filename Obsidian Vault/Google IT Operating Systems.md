- basic operating system navigation
- file and text manipulation
files folders systems hierarchiacl 
these are called paths
C:\users\cindy\desktop
in windows, file systems are assigned a letter

Root directory, the parent directory for all other directories on the sstem

subdirectories are by backslashes in windows, linux uses forward slashes
path root, then terminates at the end of path

List directories in CLI
`ls` give it the path...

parameters = value with command

`ls C:\`

the c drive is what we call a parent directory (this is too easy right now I can't pay attentino gg.

`get -help -full`

`ls -Force C:\`
lists hidden/non-standard files?

let's see what this process looks like in linux

it starts with the root...

`ls /`
lists the root directory
bin is similar to our windows program files
etc stores some pretty important system config

home = user documents, pictures, like windows users

/proc contains currently running properties

usr is user-installed software

var = logs and files that constantly changed

similar to windows, Linux uses flags, instead of parameters

`ls --help`
th

/etc
